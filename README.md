  ## Description 
  This challenge was to take a fully functioning Google API search engine that was built with a RESTful API, and refactor the code to utilize GraphQL API with Apollo Server. 

  ## Usage
- GIVEN a book search engine
- WHEN I load the search engine
- THEN I am presented with a menu with the options Search for Books and Login/Signup and an input field to search for books and a submit button
- WHEN I click on the Search for Books menu option
- THEN I am presented with an input field to search for books and a submit button
- WHEN I am not logged in and enter a search term in the input field and click the submit button
- THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site
- WHEN I click on the Login/Signup menu option
- THEN a modal appears on the screen with a toggle between the option to log in or sign up
- WHEN the toggle is set to Signup
- THEN I am presented with three inputs for a username, an email address, and a password, and a signup button
- WHEN the toggle is set to Login
- THEN I am presented with two inputs for an email address and a password and login button
- WHEN I enter a valid email address and create a password and click on the signup button
- THEN my user account is created and I am logged in to the site
- WHEN I enter my account’s email address and password and click on the login button
- THEN I the modal closes and I am logged in to the site

- THEN I am presented with several search results, each featuring a book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to save a book to my account
- WHEN I click on the Save button on a book
- THEN that book’s information is saved to my account
- WHEN I click on the option to see my saved books
- THEN I am presented with all of the books I have saved to my account, each featuring the book’s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the Google Books site and a button to remove a book from my account
- WHEN I click on the Remove button on a book
- THEN that book is deleted from my saved books list
